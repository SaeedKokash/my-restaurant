# **ANSWERS TO THE TASK QUESTIONS**

**Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?**

A1: I don't have any questions about HTML so far as I find it easy to manage and could handle it quite good in terms of functionality and coding, yet I still havent learnt styling in CSS but I've searched alot through the weekend on how to display my website as my Wireframe layout but had many difficulties understanding a few things, so hopefully I'll be able to manage it when we take it in the course.

**Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**

A2: It didnt take long to complete the main requirements of the assignement, I believe it took about 2 hours to finish the home and about pages in terms of HTML only with minimum requirements. however, for the styling with CSS as I mentioned before, it took me a while to search and learn about it so it took alot more time to do and still the home page doesnt look so good after what I've done. I thought the whole assignment will take 2-3 hours and so it did.
